Goal: 

- Record the video frames and corresponding keys pressed
- Save the data in a good format
- create a world model neural network of sonic
- stream the pixel value outputs of this model to pico-8 running it

How to I modify this pico-8 file to record the video frames and corresponding keys pressed, and what  would bea. good format to record these in? i want to 


Info:
pico-8 has 16 bit color depth, so each pixel can be represented by 4 bits.
the model should predict the 1 of 16 int value of the 128 by 128 array of pixels, conditioned on the previous 128 by 128 array of pixels and the previous action
the action is some combination of arrow keys, z, and x


Another claude came up with this: 
Here's the data collection code to add to the PICO-8 Sonic game:
luaCopy-- Add at top of file
frame_count = 0

-- Add inside _update60()
function record_frame()
    -- Get inputs as a bitfield (more efficient storage)
    local inputs = 0
    inputs |= btn(‚¨ÖÔ∏è) and 1 or 0     -- left
    inputs |= (btn(‚û°Ô∏è) and 1 or 0) << 1  -- right 
    inputs |= (btn(‚¨ÜÔ∏è) and 1 or 0) << 2  -- up
    inputs |= (btn(‚¨áÔ∏è) and 1 or 0) << 3  -- down
    inputs |= (btn(üÖæÔ∏è) and 1 or 0) << 4  -- z/o button
    inputs |= (btn(‚ùé) and 1 or 0) << 5  -- x/x button

    -- Get screen data
    local screen = ""
    for y=0,127 do
        for x=0,127 do
            screen = screen..pget(x,y)..","  -- Values will be 0-15 for PICO-8's 16 colors
        end
    end
    
    -- Save frame and inputs
    printh(frame_count..","..inputs..","..screen, "sonic_data.csv")
    frame_count += 1
end
For the other Claude, here's the key information to share:

Data Format & Structure:


Input dimensions: 128x128x1 (4 bits per pixel = 16 colors)
Actions: 6-bit vector (left, right, up, down, z, x buttons)
Frame rate: 30fps or 60fps depending on _update60()
Data format: CSV with frame_number, action_bitfield, 16384 pixels per row


Task Description:


Build a world model that predicts next frame given current frame and action
Each pixel prediction is a 16-way classification (PICO-8's 16 color palette)
Need to handle sprite animations, scrolling, physics
Model should be able to stream predictions back to PICO-8 (predictions being the 128 by 128 array of pixels)


Scale:


Planning to collect ~100K frames initially (~1 hour of gameplay)
Data will be about 8GB uncompressed (16384 pixels √ó 100K frames)
Need model that can run predictions fast enough for realtime play


Technical Details:


PICO-8 can load predicted frames via pset() per pixel
Need to handle data loading/batching of large pixel arrays
Consider using compression or sparse representations for efficiency
